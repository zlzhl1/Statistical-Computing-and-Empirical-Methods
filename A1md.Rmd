## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# wave plot
```{r}
x <- seq(0, 20, 0.01)
y <- sin(x)
sin_df <- data.frame(x, y)
head(sin_df, 3)
plot(sin_df)
# 绘制正弦波
plot(sin_df$x, sin_df$y, type = "l", col = "blue", 
     xlab = "x", ylab = "y", main = "正弦波图")
```

## **y = sin(x)**
